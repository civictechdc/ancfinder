          <p>ANC Brigade is a project of <a href="http://codefordc.org/">Code for DC</a>, which is a <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a>. We&rsquo;re volunteers interested in using technology and open data to improve our civic lives.

          <h2 id="Workin">This is a work in progress</h2>
            <p>Our goals are evolving as we get to know the ANC system better and hear from DC residents and ANC commissioners about their needs.</p> <p>At a high level, our goals include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Educate the public about DC&rsquo;s unique ANC system.</li>
                <li>Inspire DC residents to get involved in their ANC.</li>
                <li>Help residents find their ANC, its meetings, and their commissioner.</li>
                <li>Provide tools for ANC commissioners to connect with their constituents and easily publish official records.</li>
                <li>Promote transparency and accountability in the ANC system.</li>
              </ul>

          <h2 id="Whatsnext">What's next?</h2>
          <p>We&rsquo;re working on the following tasks.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the laws regarding ANCs in the DC code?</li>
            <li>How can we best explain their authority and how they have exercised it?</li>
            <li>Gathering a list of existing ANC websites, social media, etc, in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsuPWK1wtxNfdGdyVWU4Z3J3X3g3RzVyVWJ1Rkd4dXc#gid=1">google doc</a>.</li>
            <li>Tracking news about ANC decisions and spending.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
         <p>And we are thinking about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Determine what are all of the different sorts of documents produced by ANCs.</li>
            <li>Investigate what tools would be useful for commissioners (blog, CMS, wiki, etc.).</li>
            <li>Recruiting liaisons in each ANC to help record and share information about their ANC's activities.</li>
          </ul>
